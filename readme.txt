How to play: You are the hollow rectangle. Move around using the up, left, down, right buttons.
There will be flying rectangles across the screen that are either red or blue. The hollow rectangle
you control can switch between red or blue using the A (turn red) and B (turn blue) keys. Try to touch
rectangles that are the same color so you can grow larger in size and they will also go away. If you touch a rectangle that is a different color you lose. Keep going until all rectangles are cleared!
Win by clearing all the rectangles, lose by losing all your lives
